# Old Oracles
In this folder you can see all the old code that I have used to create the oracles. No nothing works anymore, because qiskit 1.1.0 changes too many things and everything is broken, from
qiskit-ibm-provider, to the transpilation part. Probably during the following years this folder will increase its dimension because of the future qiskit update.
